This directory contains some automatically converted regular designs 
from the old dat format to the new XML .had format suitable for viewing 
in HyperArt.

If you have any old dat format regular-pgon designs, you can convert 
them using the datRP2had.py script provided with HyperArt.

HyperArt doesn't support new design creation at this point (I hope to 
code it soon).

# hyperart
This is a copy of Ajit Datar's [HyperArt](http://hyperart.sourceforge.net/) project for generating and viewing repeating hypberbolic patterns.

The purpose of this repository is to have this code available for those wanting to extend this in other frameworks.

## Building
This version uses the old QT 3.3 libraries and is incompatible with QT 6.2.

It currently needs a deprecated version of an operating system to compile.
